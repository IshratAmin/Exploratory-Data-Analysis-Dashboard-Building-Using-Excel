📊 Airbnb Market Intelligence Dashboard – European Cities
 Data-Driven Financial Insights for Strategic Decision Making

I recently developed an Excel-based analytics dashboard to evaluate over 41,000 Airbnb listings across 9 key European cities, focused on uncovering market trends, pricing patterns, and ROI-driving metrics.

🔍 Key Financial Insights:

💰 Amsterdam commands the highest Average Daily Rate (ADR) across cities, suggesting strong yield potential.
📍 Budapest shows the highest listing density, presenting both saturation risk and opportunities for niche positioning.
🌟 Listings with Superhost status demonstrate a material uplift in Guest Satisfaction Index (96.92 vs. 89.04), reflecting brand equity and pricing power.
📈 Regression analysis between Attraction Index and Price reveals limited correlation (R² = 0.0285), indicating demand elasticity may be influenced more by host/service quality than geographic desirability alone.

🧮 Metrics Tracked:

Average pricing by city, room type, and day of the week
Guest satisfaction metrics stratified by host status and multi-room availability
Sensitivity of pricing to metro proximity and tourist hotspots

🎯 Use Case:

 For investors, asset managers, or short-term rental operators, this dashboard offers a robust financial lens into revenue optimization, market entry analysis, and portfolio diversification strategies.

📊 Tools: Advanced Excel (pivot models, statistical plotting, DAX-style logic)

 📂 Dataset: Airbnb Europe – 41,714 records

I’m open to collaborating on similar data modeling, pricing analytics, or real estate market assessment projects. Feel free to connect or reach out to discuss opportunities in proptech, travel analytics, or financial modeling.
